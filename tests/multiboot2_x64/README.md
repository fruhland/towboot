# multiboot2, but with EFI amd64 entry

This is the example kernel taken from [the Multiboot 2 specification](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot2/multiboot.html#Example-OS-code), but altered to be a 64-bit kernel
that starts with an EFI amd64 entry tag.

It also prints to the serial output.
